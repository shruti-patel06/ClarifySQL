"""Measures the effect of the clarification step on accuracy.

For each ambiguous test question, we already know which aggregate function
(SUM for revenue, COUNT for order count) a correct query must use. We run
every question twice: once letting the model guess on its own, and once
after supplying the clarification a user would have given. Comparing how
many queries used the right aggregate each time gives a concrete
before/after accuracy number.
